# DART App

## Overview

The **DART** app is built using **Vite**, **React**, and **Material UI** to provide a fast and responsive user experience. This application is designed with a well-structured component-based architecture to ensure maintainability and reusability.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** (for fast development and optimized builds)
- **React** (for building the user interface)
- **Material UI** (for a modern and consistent design system)

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean folder structure inside the `src` directory:

```
src/
│-- components/      # Commonly used components (Navbar, Footer)
│-- pages/           # All the pages of the app (Home, Pricing, AboutUs, AllRoutes for Routing)
│-- ui_library/      # Common UI components (Button, FeatureCard, FounderCard, PricingCard)
│-- App.jsx          # Main app component
│-- main.jsx         # Entry point for React
│-- index.css        # Global styles
```

## Approach

1. **Project Setup**: Installed Vite and configured the project with React and Material UI.
2. **Folder Structure**: Organized components into dedicated folders to ensure modularity and reusability.
3. **Common Components**:
   - **Navbar & Footer** are placed in the `components/` folder as they are used across multiple pages.
4. **Pages**:
   - Includes `Home`, `Pricing`, `AboutUs`, and `AllRoutes` (for managing application routing).
5. **UI Library**:
   - Reusable UI elements like `Button`, `FeatureCard`, `FounderCard`, and `PricingCard` are stored in the `ui_library/` folder for easy accessibility and scalability.
6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensured full responsiveness for all screen sizes using Material UI's responsive system (`sx` props, flex/grid layouts).

## Features

- **Fully responsive** for all devices
- **Optimized performance** using Vite
- **Reusable UI components**
- **Modern design with Material UI**
